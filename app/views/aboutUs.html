            <li><b>Safety</b>
                <br> All employees undergo an initial probationary period. They are trained in proper cleaning techniques/correct operating procedures for equipment and supplies. We use PPE to minimize exposure to workplace injuries. Safety is our number one priority.

             <li><b>Accountability</b>
                <br> TMC strongly believes in the necessity of close and thorough supervision. We carefully detail each employeeâ€™s duties to them, oversee their work, and systematically check to make certain their work remains at a consistently high level.
